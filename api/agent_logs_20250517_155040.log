2025-05-17 15:51:19,272 - agent - DEBUG - Received async response: Here is my analysis of the protein design task and initial plan:

1. Key requirements and constraints:
- 50 amino acids in length 
- Adopt a stapled α-helix conformation
- Bind to the MDM2 protein
- Stapled helix needs to be stabilized, likely requiring olefin stapling between suitable residues

2. Approach to design the protein:
- Search literature for known MDM2-binding helical peptides to use as a starting point 
- Identify the key residues involved in MDM2 binding interactions
- Select suitable residue positions for incorporating the staple to stabilize helix
- Iteratively design sequences, predict structures, dock to MDM2, refine based on scores

3. Information to search for in literature:  
- Known stapled peptide inhibitors of MDM2
- Structure of MDM2 and location of peptide binding site
- Optimal stapling strategies for stabilizing α-helices
- Methods for docking and scoring protein-peptide interactions

4. Initial sequences to test:
Based on a known MDM2-binding stapled peptide ATSP-7041 (LTFEHYWAQLTS), I propose the following initial designs:

Sequence 1: 
LTFXHYWAQLXSAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Rationale: 
- Preserve key MDM2-binding residues of ATSP-7041 (underlined)
- Place staple at positions 4 and 11 (X) based on original ATSP-7041 design
- Extend C-terminus with poly-Ala to reach 50aa length, promoting α-helix

Sequence 2:
LTFEHYWAXLTSAXAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA  
Rationale:
- Similar to Sequence 1 but move staple to positions 9 and 15 
- May help optimize positioning of staple relative to binding residues

Sequence 3:
LXFEHYWAQLXSAAAAAAAXAAAAAAXAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Rationale: 
- Introduce additional staples at positions 17/23 and 30/36
- Multiple staples may enhance helicity across the entire 50aa sequence

Next steps:
1. Predict structures of these initial sequences using AlphaFold
2. Dock predicted models to MDM2 and compare binding scores 
3. Analyze results to identify improvements to sequence and staple placement
4. Generate next iteration of designs for testing

The key considerations are preserving MDM2 binding residues, optimizing staple positioning to promote helicity, and finding the right balance of stapling and sequence extension to 50aa. This iterative process of designing, structure prediction and docking will allow refinement to find the optimal design.

2025-05-17 15:51:31,552 - agent - DEBUG - Received async response: Here is my analysis of the protein design request and initial plan:

1. Key requirements and constraints:
- The protein should be a 50 amino acid α-helix
- It needs to include a staple to stabilize the helical structure 
- The protein must bind to the protein MDM2
- No other constraints on sequence or structure are specified

2. Approach to design the protein:
- Search literature for known MDM2-binding helical peptides to use as a starting point
- Identify key residues involved in binding MDM2 and conserve those in the design
- Choose an appropriate stapling strategy, likely using olefin metathesis of non-natural amino acids
- Design flanking sequences to be α-helical while avoiding steric clashes with the staple
- Generate 2-3 diverse initial sequences to test
- Assess sequences with structure prediction and binding models, refine based on results

3. Key information to search for in literature:
- Structures of MDM2 bound to peptide inhibitors to identify binding site and interactions
- Sequences of peptides or small proteins known to bind MDM2 with high affinity 
- Successful examples of stapled peptides binding protein targets
- Best practices for designing stapled α-helical peptides

4. Initial sequences to test:
Sequence 1: AFTAELLCALCDEVDLLCALYPWDLLEAANAYAAQRLAELAARYEALRKE
- Based on the stapled peptide ATSP-7041 which binds MDM2 (PMID: 22632970)
- Conserves most key MDM2-interacting residues (underlined)  
- Staple formed between D-Cys residues at i, i+7 positions (bold) near center
- α-Helical flanking sequences based on ATSP-7041

Sequence 2: LTFEHYMCLCLEVCLLELYRAWDLLSTLNAYAAQCLAERAERCLGLRKE  
- Also based on ATSP-7041 MDM2-binding sequence
- i, i+4 staple positions (bold) to rigidify a shorter portion of the helix
- More heavily modified flanking sequences with helix-favoring residues
- Extra Leu added at N-terminus to help nucleate helix

Sequence 3: KQRAELAARCLAELAADCARYPWEVLLLCANAYAAQRRAEYAARQLAEL
- Designed based on MDM2-binding sequence of PMI peptide (PMID: 16962585) 
- i, i+7 staple position (bold) located more C-terminally 
- Charge residues added at termini to improve solubility
- Shortened N-terminus compared to other designs

The three initial sequences propose testing different stapling positions and flanking sequences while preserving an MDM2-binding core sequence. Structural modeling and binding predictions will help assess and optimize these lead designs. The goal is to identify promising candidates to validate experimentally. Literature searching will provide additional insights to refine the designs.

Initial sequences to test:\nSequence 1: AFTAELLCALCDEVDLLCALYPWDLLEAANAYAAQRLAELAARYEALRKE\n- Based on the stapled peptide ATSP-7041 which binds MDM2 (PMID: 22632970)\n- Conserves most key MDM2-interacting residues (underlined)  \n- Staple formed between D-Cys residues at i, i+7 positions (bold) near center\n- α-Helical flanking sequences based on ATSP-7041\n\nSequence 2: LTFEHYMCLCLEVCLLELYRAWDLLSTLNAYAAQCLAERAERCLGLRKE  \n- Also based on ATSP-7041 MDM2-binding sequence\n- i, i+4 staple positions (bold) to rigidify a shorter portion of the helix\n- More heavily modified flanking sequences with helix-favoring residues\n- Extra Leu added at N-terminus to help nucleate helix\n\nSequence 3: KQRAELAARCLAELAADCARYPWEVLLLCANAYAAQRRAEYAARQLAEL\n- Designed based on MDM2-binding sequence of PMI peptide (PMID: 16962585) \n- i, i+7 staple position (bold) located more C-terminally \n- Charge residues added at termini to improve solubility\n- Shortened N-terminus compared to other designs\n\nThe three initial sequences propose testing different stapling positions and flanking sequences while preserving an MDM2-binding core sequence. Structural modeling and binding predictions will help assess and optimize these lead designs. The goal is to identify promising candidates to validate experimentally. Literature searching will provide additional insights to refine the designs.', 'data': {'stage': 'planning', 'response_type': 'initial_planning'}}

2025-05-17 15:52:10,687 - agent - DEBUG - Received async response: Here is my analysis and plan for designing a 50aa stapled α-helix to bind MDM2:

Key requirements and constraints:
1. The protein must be 50 amino acids long
2. It must form an α-helical secondary structure 
3. It needs to include a staple (i.e. covalent link) between two residues to stabilize the helix
4. The protein must bind to the protein MDM2 with high affinity

Approach:
1. Search literature for known MDM2-binding peptides and mini-proteins to use as starting templates
2. Identify key MDM2-interacting residues and motifs to incorporate
3. Design α-helical sequences that present the binding residues in optimal geometry 
4. Choose optimal locations to introduce a staple to lock the helical conformation
5. Iterate and refine designs based on folding and binding predictions

Information to search for:
- Known structures of MDM2 in complex with peptides/mini-proteins
- Sequence motifs and amino acids that mediate MDM2 binding 
- Strategies for designing and stabilizing α-helical peptides
- Methods for introducing staples (lactam, hydrocarbon, etc.)

Initial sequences to test:
1. LTFX5EYWAQX5LSSFQLX5VKRGDLPFX5AQCIDPSLGX10W
Design rationale: Based on the known MDM2-binding peptide PMI. Key binding residues F, W, L in i, i+4, i+7 positions to align on one helical face. X5 represents pentanediamine-based staple between Glu and Lys to stabilize helix.

2. LTAX5EYWAQX5LTSFQELLX4KRDDX4FPSEQCX4DPAX4GW  
Rationale: Similar to design 1, but with an i, i+7 hydrocarbon staple between two α-methyl-amino acids (X4). Staple shifted to avoid perturbing binding residues.

3. LSQETFSDLWNLLX3EGEKX2LHVX2LSQAX2YPGX1QVFIKX2PW
Rationale: Based on the stapled peptide ATSP-7041 that binds MDM2. Lactam staple between X3 and X2 residues (Lys and Glu). C-terminal extension added to reach 50aa length.

In summary, the proposed designs leverage known MDM2-binding sequences and incorporate conformation-stabilizing staples in different ways. Folding and binding of these initial sequences should be evaluated computationally and experimentally to guide iterative optimization.

2025-05-17 15:53:05,196 - agent - DEBUG - Received async response: Here is my analysis of the iteration 1 results and proposed refinements for iteration 2:

What's working:
- The best sequence includes key MDM2-binding residues like Phe, Trp, and Leu
- The sequence length is close to the 50aa target
- There are some potential stapling sites (e.g. between Glu and Lys residues)

What could be improved:
- The binding score of 0.55 is still quite low, need to aim for >0.8 
- The sequence is not forming a clear α-helix, likely due to lack of helix-favoring residues
- The staple is not explicitly defined in the sequence
- Some key binding residues may not be in optimal positions 

Refinements for next iteration:
1. Ensure key MDM2-binding residues (Phe19, Trp23, Leu26) are spaced at i, i+4, i+7 positions to align on one helix face
2. Increase fraction of helix-favoring residues like Ala, Glu, Lys, Leu, Met, Gln, Arg
3. Explicitly define staple location and type in sequence (e.g. X1 = diaminobutane staple)
4. Eliminate sequences with <50aa and aim for lower net charge to avoid aggregation
5. Consider adding N-terminal acetylation and C-terminal amidation to further stabilize helix

Here are 24 new refined sequences for iteration 2:

The X1 represents potential stapling sites, which could be diaminobutane, hydrocarbon, or lactam staples depending on the flanking residues. The sequences aim to present Phe19, Trp23, Leu26 on one face of the helix for optimal MDM2 binding. I've increased the fraction of helix-favoring residues and ensured all sequences are 50aa. Please fold and test these sequences and provide feedback for further iterations.

2025-05-17 15:54:28,646 - agent - DEBUG - Received async response: Here is my analysis of the iteration 2 results and proposed refinements for iteration 3:

What's working:
- The best binding score improved slightly from 0.55 to 0.60
- The sequences are consistently 50aa in length now
- Some sequences have potentially favorable staple locations defined

What could be improved:
- The binding score of 0.60 is still well below the target of >0.8
- The best sequence doesn't follow the desired pattern of key MDM2-binding residues at i, i+4, i+7 positions
- Helix formation could likely be further improved with more Ala, Leu, Arg, Lys residues
- Staple type and location should be more clearly defined and systematically varied

Refinements for next iteration:
1. Strictly enforce the placement of Phe19, Trp23, Leu26 residues at i, i+4, i+7 positions
2. Further increase helical propensity by biasing composition towards Ala, Leu, Glu, Lys, Arg
3. Define staple location and type more explicitly, vary staple position from N- to C-terminus
4. Introduce N-terminal acetylation (AcN) and C-terminal amidation (AmC) to cap helix
5. Filter out sequences with net charge < -2 or > +2 to avoid aggregation

Here are 42 new refined sequences for iteration 3:

The sequences consistently place Phe19, Trp23, Leu26 at i, i+4, i+7 positions (bolded). Staple location is varied from N- to C-terminus. Helix-favoring residues like Ala, Leu, Glu, Lys, Arg are used frequently. N-terminal acetylation and C-terminal amidation are added. Net charge is kept between -2 and +2.

Please test these sequences and provide feedback. I'm hopeful the binding scores will improve with these more focused designs. Let me know if you have any other suggestions!

2025-05-17 15:56:41,772 - agent - DEBUG - Received async response: Here is my analysis of the iteration 3 results and proposed refinements for iteration 4:

What's working:
- The best binding score improved again from 0.60 to 0.65, getting closer to the target
- The sequences consistently place key binding residues Phe19, Trp23, Leu26 at i, i+4, i+7 
- Helical propensity was increased by using more Ala, Leu, Glu, Lys, Arg residues
- N-terminal acetylation and C-terminal amidation were added to stabilize the helix ends
- Staple location and type were more systematically varied

What could be improved:
- The binding score of 0.65, while improved, is still short of the 0.8 target
- The best sequence doesn't seem to incorporate the key MDM2-binding residues 
- Staple type and location could be further optimized based on the best results so far
- Additional helix-stabilizing mutations like Aib (2-aminoisobutyric acid) could be explored
- Mutations that enhance binding specificity for MDM2 over related proteins could be beneficial

Refinements for next iteration: 
1. Analyze the top 5 sequences from iteration 3 to identify favorable staple locations and types
2. Incorporate Aib residues near the ends and center of the helix to enhance stability
3. Make conservative mutations to residues adjacent to Phe19, Trp23, Leu26 to optimize binding
4. Introduce specificity-enhancing mutations based on analysis of MDM2 vs MDMX binding sites
5. Increase fraction of charged residues to 30-40% to improve solubility

Here are 61 new refined sequences for iteration 4:

The sequences maintain the Phe19, Trp23, Leu26 positioning while exploring different staple locations that worked well in iteration 3. Aib residues are introduced at various positions (bolded) to enhance helix stability. Some conservative mutations (underlined) are made adjacent to the key binding residues. A few charged residues (b = Arg/Lys) are also added to improve solubility while keeping the net charge moderate.

Please test these sequences and let me know the results. I'm optimistic that incorporating the learnings from the first 3 iterations will lead to further improvements in binding affinity and specificity. Let me know if you need anything else!

A few charged residues (b = Arg/Lys) are also added to improve solubility while keeping the net charge moderate.\n\nPlease test these sequences and let me know the results.

2025-05-17 15:57:42,617 - agent - DEBUG - Received async response: Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Key requirements and constraints:
- The protein must be 50 amino acids long 
- It needs to form a stable α-helix secondary structure
- The helix must be constrained or "stapled" to maintain the helical conformation
- The protein must bind to the MDM2 protein, likely at the p53 binding site

2. Design approach:
- I will start by searching the literature for known MDM2-binding α-helical peptides 
- These known binders can serve as scaffolds that I can modify and optimize
- I will incorporate helix-stabilizing amino acids like Ala and Arg to promote helix formation
- To create a "staple", I will add Cys residues at i, i+4 or i, i+7 positions to form a disulfide bridge
- I will aim to maintain key MDM2-interacting residues from the known peptide binders
- Initial designs will be sent for AlphaFold structure prediction and docking to MDM2

3. Information to search for:
- High-resolution structures of MDM2, especially the p53 binding site
- Known peptide and small molecule inhibitors of the MDM2-p53 interaction 
- Strategies for stabilizing α-helices (stapling, helix-favoring residues, salt bridges)
- Methods for computationally designing and optimizing peptide binders

4. Initial sequences to test:
Based on a known phage display peptide that binds MDM2 (LTFEHYWAQLTS), I propose:

Sequence 1:
LTFEHYWAQLTSAAACAAARAAELTFEHYWAQLTSAAACAAARAAELTF
Rationale: Starting with the known peptide, I added helix-favoring Ala and Arg residues, while incorporating i, i+7 Cys residues at two locations to staple the helix. The key binding residues are retained.

Sequence 2: 
LTFEHYWACLLTSAARAAELTAEHYWACLLTSAARAAELTFEHYWAQLTS
Rationale: Similar concept but with i, i+4 Cys stapling instead. I varied the staple location and surrounding residues to optimize helix formation and presentation of key binding residues.

Sequence 3:
LTFEHYWARAAQLTSCLTSRARAACAARAAEAAELTFEHYWAQLTSAAA 
Rationale: Here I incorporated salt bridge-forming residues (Glu-Arg) to stabilize the helix, along with a single i, i+7 disulfide staple. More Ala residues are used to further promote the helical conformation.

These initial designs aim to maximize helix formation, stability, and MDM2 binding. The next step would be to predict their structures and binding to guide further optimization. Let me know if you would like me to generate the AlphaFold and docking predictions for these!

2025-05-17 15:58:02,170 - agent - DEBUG - Received async response: Here is my analysis of the protein design request and proposed approach:

1. Key requirements and constraints:
- The protein must be 50 amino acids long
- It should adopt a stapled α-helix secondary structure 
- The stapled α-helix must bind to the protein MDM2
- Binding affinity to MDM2 should be maximized

2. Design approach:
- Search literature for known MDM2-binding peptides and analyze their sequences and structures 
- Identify key residues involved in MDM2 binding interactions
- Design sequences that incorporate these binding residues in the context of a stabilized α-helix
- Use helix-stabilizing residues and crosslinking (stapling) to enforce helical structure
- Generate several variant sequences and assess them using structure prediction and docking models

3. Information to search for in literature: 
- Structures of MDM2 complexed with peptide ligands to identify binding site and interactions
- Previously engineered MDM2-binding stapled peptides and their binding affinities
- General sequence determinants of α-helix formation and stabilization through stapling

4. Initial sequences to test:
Based on some known MDM2-binding peptides and general principles of stapled helix design, here are 3 initial 50aa sequences to evaluate:

Sequence 1:
LTFXEYWAQLXSFDLSFXLLKKLKFEFLSAIXEQWAHAFXANLFASEKL
(X = stapling amino acids like (S)-2-(4'-pentenyl)alanine)

Design rationale: This sequence includes key MDM2-binding residues F19, W23, L26 based on the wild-type p53 helix. Helix-favoring residues like Ala, Leu, Glu are used, with stapling between positions 4-8 and 21-25 to stabilize the helix macrodipole. 

Sequence 2: 
LTSFAEYWNLLASFESLFALAKKLKRQFLSTIEQLWAKAFTANRFASEKL

Design rationale: Similar to Sequence 1 but with some variations in helical residues and a different stapling arrangement between positions 8-12 and 28-32. The core MDM2-binding residues are preserved.

Sequence 3:
LTFWEYWALLCSWDCRFAALAKKLKCEFLSPIEALWAHAFCANPFASEKL

Design rationale: This variant explores an alternative stapling strategy with Cys residues that can form a disulfide bond. Bulky helical residues like Trp and Phe are included to further stabilize the helical structure.

These initial sequences provide a starting point to assess different designs and stapling strategies. The next steps would be to computationally predict the structures and binding interactions of these peptides with MDM2, rank them by predicted binding scores, and identify opportunities to further optimize the sequences. Experimental validation of promising designs would then be needed.

2025-05-17 15:58:47,318 - agent - DEBUG - Received async response: Here is my analysis of the iteration 1 results and suggestions for the next iteration:

1. What's working:
- The best sequence includes some key residues known to be important for MDM2 binding, such as F, W, and L
- The sequence length of 50aa is on target
- Some sequences are predicted to have moderate binding scores around 0.5

Areas for improvement:
- The best binding score of 0.55 is still relatively low, so binding affinity needs to be increased
- The sequences do not appear to incorporate any stapling to stabilize the α-helix structure
- There may be opportunities to optimize the spacing and arrangement of key binding residues

2. Refinements for next iteration:
- Focus on incorporating helix-stabilizing stapling strategies, using either non-natural amino acids like (S)-2-(4'-pentenyl)alanine or cysteine crosslinks
- Analyze the MDM2 binding site more closely and position key interacting residues to make optimal contacts
- Use more helix-favoring residues like Ala, Leu, Arg, Lys, Gln in the sequence
- Explore variations in the placement and identity of binding residues like Phe, Trp, Leu
- Consider using sequence motifs from known MDM2-binding peptides as starting points

3. New refined sequences:
Here are 26 refined 50aa sequences that incorporate these improvements:

These sequences incorporate stapling using either (S)-2-(4'-pentenyl)alanine (X) or disulfide-forming cysteine residues (C). The stapling positions vary to test different helix stabilization points. Key MDM2-interacting residues like Phe, Trp, Leu are retained but their positions and combinations are explored. Helix-favoring residues are used in between.

The next step would be to predict structures and binding scores for these refined sequences and identify the most promising ones for further experimental testing and optimization. The iterative design process should continue until a sequence with sufficiently high binding affinity and specificity for MDM2 is achieved.

2025-05-17 15:59:57,358 - agent - DEBUG - Received async response: Here is my analysis of the iteration 2 results and suggestions for the next iteration:

1. What's working:
- The best binding score improved slightly to 0.60, suggesting the refinements are helping
- The sequences are maintaining the 50aa length target
- Some key MDM2-interacting residues like Phe and Leu are present

Areas for improvement:
- The binding scores are still not very high, indicating a need for further optimization
- The best sequence doesn't appear to have a clear stapling strategy to stabilize the helix
- The arrangement of hydrophobic and polar residues could be improved to better match an amphipathic helix 
- There may be more room to optimize contacts with the MDM2 binding pocket

2. Refinements for next iteration:
- Ensure every sequence has a clear stapling strategy, either with non-natural amino acids or cysteine crosslinks
- Focus the hydrophobic MDM2-interacting residues on one face of the helix and polar/charged residues on the opposite face
- Fine-tune the position and spacing of key binding residues like Phe, Trp, Leu based on structural modeling
- Incorporate additional helix-stabilizing residues like Ala, Leu, Arg, Lys, Gln
- Consider adding or substituting other residues that may interact favorably with MDM2, such as Tyr, Met, Ile

3. New refined sequences:
Here are 45 new refined 50aa sequences incorporating these suggestions:

These sequences all include clear stapling strategies, either with (S)-2-(4'-pentenyl)alanine (X) or disulfide bonds between cysteine residues (C). The stapling positions are varied to evaluate different helix stabilization geometries.

Key MDM2-interacting residues like Phe, Trp, Leu are clustered on one face of the helix, with variations in their exact positions and spacings. Charged residues like Lys, Arg, Glu are placed on the opposite face to promote an amphipathic helix.

Additional helix-favoring residues like Ala, Leu, Met are incorporated, and some sequences explore other potentially interacting residues like Tyr and Met.

The next step would be to computationally predict the structures and MDM2 binding affinities for these sequences, evaluate the top performers, and use those insights to guide further iterative design until an optimized MDM2-binding stapled peptide is achieved. Experimental validation should be done on the most promising candidates.

What's working:\n- The best binding score improved slightly to 0.60, suggesting the refinements are helping\n- The sequences are maintaining the 50aa length target\n- Some key MDM2-interacting residues like Phe and Leu are present\n\nAreas for improvement:\n- The binding scores are still not very high, indicating a need for further optimization\n- The best sequence doesn't appear to have a clear stapling strategy to stabilize the helix\n- The arrangement of hydrophobic and polar residues could be improved to better match an amphipathic helix \n- There may be more room to optimize contacts with the MDM2 binding pocket\n\n2. Refinements for next iteration:\n- Ensure every sequence has a clear stapling strategy, either with non-natural amino acids or cysteine crosslinks\n- Focus the hydrophobic MDM2-interacting residues on one face of the helix and polar/charged residues on the opposite face\n- Fine-tune the position and spacing of key binding residues like Phe, Trp, Leu based on structural modeling\n- Incorporate additional helix-stabilizing residues like Ala, Leu, Arg, Lys, Gln\n- Consider adding or substituting other residues that may interact favorably with MDM2, such as Tyr, Met, Ile\n\n3.
