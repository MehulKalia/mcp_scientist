# Design of a 50-aa Stapled α-Helix for MDM2 Binding

Based on the provided paper on MEGADOCK-GUI, I'll approach this protein design challenge by leveraging computational protein-protein docking principles to design an effective MDM2-binding stapled peptide.

## Background Analysis

MDM2 is a negative regulator of the p53 tumor suppressor, and disrupting the MDM2-p53 interaction is a validated therapeutic approach for cancer treatment. Stapled α-helices can mimic the MDM2-binding region of p53, providing enhanced stability and cell penetration compared to unmodified peptides.

## Design Strategy

1. **Base Sequence Design**: Begin with the p53 helical region that naturally binds to MDM2 (residues 15-29), which contains the critical triad of F19, W23, and L26 that insert into MDM2's hydrophobic cleft.

2. **Extension to 50-aa**: Extend the core binding sequence with stabilizing helical elements while maintaining the binding interface.

3. **Staple Positions**: Position hydrocarbon staples to:
   - Reinforce the α-helical structure
   - Not interfere with the key binding residues
   - Connect i, i+4 or i, i+7 positions on the non-binding face of the helix

## Proposed Sequence (50-aa)

Where:
- Bold residues represent the key MDM2-binding triad (F19, W23, L26 of native p53)
- Underlined positions indicate staple locations (to be replaced with non-natural amino acids containing olefin side chains)

## Staple Positions

I propose two staples at the following positions:
1. Positions 8 and 12 (i, i+4 staple)
2. Positions 32 and 39 (i, i+7 staple)

The residues at these positions would be replaced with S5 (for i, i+4) or R8 (for i, i+7) non-natural amino acids containing olefin side chains that can be joined via ring-closing metathesis.

## Rationale

1. **Hydrophobic Binding Interface**: Retains the critical F, W, L residues that insert into MDM2's binding pocket.

2. **Helicity Enhancement**: Includes helix-favoring residues (A, L, E, K) throughout the sequence.

3. **Charge Distribution**: Positions charged residues (E, K, R) to form salt bridges that stabilize the helix.

4. **Staple Placement**: Places staples on the solvent-exposed face of the helix, opposite the MDM2-binding interface.

5. **N- and C-terminal Capping**: Uses helix-capping motifs to stabilize the termini.

This design creates a highly stable, extended helical peptide that should maintain the critical binding interactions with MDM2 while exhibiting enhanced pharmacological properties compared to unmodified peptides.
