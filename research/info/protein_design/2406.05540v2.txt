Based on the information provided in the paper, I'll design a 50-amino acid stapled α-helix that can bind to MDM2, which is an important target in protein design, particularly for cancer therapeutics.

# Designing a 50-aa Stapled α-Helix for MDM2 Binding

To design an effective MDM2-binding stapled peptide, I'll incorporate key principles from protein design research:

## Key Design Considerations:
1. The peptide needs to mimic the p53 transactivation domain, which naturally binds to MDM2
2. Critical binding residues (Phe19, Trp23, Leu26 from p53) must be positioned correctly
3. Stapling will enhance the α-helical structure, proteolytic stability, and cell penetration
4. The staple position should not interfere with the key binding interface

## Proposed 50-aa Stapled Peptide Sequence:
```

```

Where:
- X1 and X2 are non-natural amino acids (e.g., (S)-pentenylalanine) for stapling
- The core MDM2-binding region contains the key residues (Phe, Trp, Leu) in the correct spacing
- Additional residues are added to extend to 50-aa while maintaining helicity
- The staple is positioned on the opposite face from the binding interface
- C-terminal region includes flexible residues (GGASA) to prevent aggregation

## Stapling Strategy:
- Hydrocarbon stapling between positions X1 and X2 (i, i+7 spacing)
- This creates a stabilized α-helix that maintains the critical binding residues in the proper orientation for MDM2 recognition
- The staple is positioned to reinforce the helical structure without interfering with the binding interface

This design combines critical MDM2-binding elements with modern stapled peptide technology to create a potentially high-affinity, cell-penetrant inhibitor of the p53-MDM2 interaction, which could have applications in cancer therapeutics.
