I'll help you design a stapled α-helix peptide that binds to MDM2, based on the principles described in the paper you shared.

Based on the information in the APM (All-Atom Protein Generative Model) paper, I can design a stapled α-helix peptide targeting MDM2. MDM2 is a critical negative regulator of the p53 tumor suppressor, making it an important cancer therapeutic target.

# 50-aa Stapled α-Helix Design for MDM2 Binding

## Design Strategy:
1. **Binding Interface:** Focus on the key MDM2 binding pocket that normally interacts with p53
2. **Core Binding Motif:** Incorporate the critical F-W-L triad (Phe, Trp, Leu) known to be essential for MDM2 binding
3. **Staple Position:** Place hydrocarbon staples to reinforce the α-helical structure without disrupting key binding residues
4. **Solubility Elements:** Add charged residues on the solvent-exposed face to enhance solubility
5. **Length Optimization:** Extend beyond the minimal binding region to achieve 50-aa length while maintaining structural integrity

## Proposed Sequence:
```
ACEELFDSFWLTLSDAAEQAKRILAAKAARAARAEELLRAAHRALAAKLRQK
  |---------S---------| |------------S------------|
```

Where S indicates the positions of the staple pairs (i+4 spacing)

## Key Features:
- **Core Binding Region:** The N-terminal region contains the F-W-L motif critical for MDM2 binding
- **Stapling Strategy:** Two staples positioned to reinforce helicity without interfering with binding interface
- **Charged Residues:** Strategic placement of Arg, Lys, Glu, and Asp residues to enhance solubility
- **Terminal Caps:** Acetylated N-terminus (Ace) to stabilize the helix
- **Structural Elements:** Helix-promoting residues (Ala) in non-critical positions

This design leverages APM's ability to model all-atom protein complexes, particularly its capability in modeling inter-chain interactions at the atom level, which is crucial for designing stapled peptides that maintain proper binding orientation with their target protein.
