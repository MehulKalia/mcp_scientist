# Designing a Stapled α-Helix for MDM2 Binding

Based on the research paper provided, I'll design an optimal 50-amino acid stapled α-helix that binds to MDM2, leveraging both the computational framework described in TourSynbio-Agent and protein design principles.

## Design Approach

I'll structure this design based on key insights from successful protein engineering approaches:

1. **Target Understanding**: MDM2 binds to a helical region of p53 through key hydrophobic residues
2. **Structure Optimization**: Using a stapled peptide approach to enhance stability and binding affinity
3. **Sequence Design**: Incorporating critical binding residues while maintaining helical propensity

## Key Design Elements

### Core Binding Residues
The MDM2 binding interface requires three critical hydrophobic residues that mimic the p53-MDM2 interaction:
- Phe19 (equivalent to Phe19 in p53)
- Trp23 (equivalent to Trp23 in p53)
- Leu26 (equivalent to Leu26 in p53)

### Stapling Strategy
I'll incorporate two pairs of non-natural amino acids for chemical stapling:
- Position 12 and 16: (S)-pentenyl alanine residues (R8)
- Position 31 and 35: (S)-pentenyl alanine residues (R8)

### Helical Stabilization
- Alanine, leucine and glutamate residues in non-interface positions to promote helical structure
- Strategically placed salt bridges (Glu-Lys pairs) to stabilize the helix
- Helix-capping residues at the N and C termini (Asn, Gly)

Where R8 represents the (S)-pentenyl alanine residues for stapling.

## Design Rationale

1. **N-terminal cap**: GSD sequence to stabilize the helix start
2. **First staple region**: Positions 12-16 (R8-R8) to stabilize the central binding region
3. **Critical binding residues**:
   - Phe19 (F) for hydrophobic interaction
   - Trp23 (W) for deep pocket binding
   - Leu26 (L) for hydrophobic interaction
4. **Second staple region**: Positions 31-35 (R8-R8) to further stabilize the helix
5. **C-terminal cap**: GLGE sequence for helix termination stability

This design leverages the TourSynbio-Agent approach described in the paper, incorporating both computational prediction and structural optimization principles. The double-stapled design should provide enhanced proteolytic stability while maintaining the critical binding interface needed for MDM2 interaction.

The sequence is designed to adopt a stable α-helical structure with approximately 3.6 residues per turn, positioning the key binding residues (F19, W23, L26) on the same face of the helix for optimal MDM2 interaction.
