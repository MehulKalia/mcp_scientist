# Design of a 50-aa Stapled α-Helix for MDM2 Binding

Based on the SAGE-Prot framework described in the paper, I'll design a 50-amino acid stapled α-helix peptide that binds to MDM2 with high affinity.

## Design Strategy

The paper describes SAGE-Prot as a framework that iteratively combines autoregressive protein generation with quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) models to optimize protein sequences for specific properties. This is perfect for designing a stapled peptide to target MDM2.

## Key Design Elements

1. **Core MDM2 Binding Motif**: Incorporating the key residues that mediate p53-MDM2 interaction (Phe19, Trp23, and Leu26 in p53)

2. **Helicity Promotion**: Including helix-stabilizing residues (Ala, Leu, Arg, Glu)

3. **Staple Placement**: Positioning the staple between residues i and i+4 to maintain the α-helix

4. **Solubility Enhancement**: Adding charged residues on the solvent-exposed face

5. **Length Optimization**: Extending to 50 aa while maintaining structural integrity

## Proposed Sequence

```
XEAALAREWXAYLDALLKKHEAALAKKLEAAIRKKLEAELRKKLEALRKKA
```

Where X represents non-natural amino acids for stapling (typically pentenyl alanine derivatives)

## Design Rationale

1. **Binding Interface**:
   - REWA motif incorporates key hydrophobic residues that mimic p53's MDM2-binding region
   - YLDAL provides additional hydrophobic contacts with MDM2's binding pocket

2. **Helical Stability**:
   - Stapling between positions 1 and 5 (X-X) reinforces the α-helical structure
   - High helix propensity residues (Ala, Leu) throughout the sequence

3. **Solubility**:
   - Charged residues (Arg, Glu, Lys) positioned on the solvent-exposed face
   - Alternating positive and negative charges to prevent aggregation

4. **Extended Structure**:
   - Repeating helical motifs in the C-terminal region to maintain the overall structure
   - Gradual transition from the binding region to structural stabilizing region

This design would benefit from experimental validation using the methods described in the paper, particularly the iterative optimization approach that combines generation and evaluation in SAGE-Prot.
