# Designing a Stapled α-Helix for MDM2 Binding

Based on the provided paper on Protein FID, I'll design a stapled α-helix peptide that effectively binds to MDM2. This is an important therapeutic target as MDM2 negatively regulates p53, a critical tumor suppressor.

## Design Rationale

The paper discusses how current protein structure generative models are often evaluated by designability, novelty, and diversity metrics, but these don't fully capture how well models sample the design space represented in training data. For my MDM2-binding peptide design, I'll incorporate considerations about structural complexity, contact order, and substructure diversity that were highlighted as important in the paper.

## Key Design Requirements
1. The peptide must form a stable α-helix
2. It must contain binding residues that interact with MDM2's p53-binding pocket
3. It needs a staple to stabilize the helical structure
4. The design should have appropriate contact order for stability

### Design Features:

1. **Core MDM2 Binding Region**: 
   - Contains key hydrophobic residues (F, W, L) at positions that interact with MDM2's binding pocket
   - Based on the p53 peptide sequence known to bind MDM2

2. **Staple Positions**:
   - Incorporates non-natural amino acids (denoted as X) at i, i+4 positions (positions 18 and 22)
   - The staple is positioned on the face opposite to the MDM2 binding interface to avoid interference

3. **Helix-Stabilizing Elements**:
   - Includes alanine and leucine residues that have high helix propensity
   - N-cap and C-cap sequences to stabilize helix termini

4. **Contact Order Considerations**:
   - Designed with appropriate spacing of interacting residues
   - Incorporates side chains that can form stabilizing interactions within the helix

5. **Solubility Features**:
   - Contains charged residues (K, E) distributed along the solvent-exposed face
   - Balances hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues for proper folding

This design incorporates principles from the paper, particularly regarding structural complexity and maintaining important tertiary structural motifs while ensuring the peptide retains the critical features needed for MDM2 binding.
